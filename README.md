# InventoryManagementSystem

Hey good people, It is a project of my university course CSE-2200 Course Title:"Advanced Programming"
The task was to make a desktop application usnig the language Java.
So I used Java as my programming language and used CSS to design the UI more perfectly.
Also MYSQL was used for database management.
Platoform:
  a. IntelIJ
  b . JAVA SDK 8
  c. MYSQL server 8.0


If you want to use this application then complete the following setup:
1. Install Intelij
2. Install MYSQL server 8.0 with user="root" PASSWORD="root"
3. Install JDK 8
4. Create a basic project in Intelij with JDK 8
5. Replace your project src folder with this src folder
6. Cpoy "images" and "lib" folders to your project folder
7. Create a database "inventory" in your MYSQL server
8. Then copy all the sql files from sql folder and paste it to your MYSQL Workbench one by one
9. Add all the JAR files from lib folder to your project dependencies.
10. Then run the main program and you are all set.
